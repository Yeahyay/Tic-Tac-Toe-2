A raw input specifies a specific device input to recieve.
It contains a value associated with it.
It can have multiple dimensions.

An input is a named control and its different raw inputs.
A single control can use different input from any raw inputs.
Like binding fire to left mouse, right bumper, or a screen tap.
Inputs can be either a single input or a combination of inputs.

An input context is a collection of input inputs that are used in a specific
context.
Input contexts represent controls that occupy different sections of a program.
Like controls for different characters or vehicles.
Or a prompt to open a door.

An input scheme is a collection of input contexts to define an entire control
scheme.
Useful for foreign keyboard layouts or control scheme profiles.

A scheme manager decides which input scheme to use.

The input system has scheme managers and sends input events to them.
Input system broadcast the activated inputs as event messages.


Raw Inputs can be scalar or vector and are normalized between 0 and 1.


Inputs have 4 states, start, hold, stop, idle.
	-> Start is when an input is first pressed or when a significant signal
		change is reached.
		It is triggered once.
	-> Hold is when an input has been pressed but not released
		It is triggered constantly.
	-> Stop is when an input has been released
		It is triggered once.
	-> Idle is when an input is not being used
		It is triggered once. constantly???

An input can support an arbitrary number of consecutive presses given a
different, defined timing window for each or a single timing window for each.
